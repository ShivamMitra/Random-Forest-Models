## Overview
This repository showcases practical examples of the Random Forest algorithm for both classification and regression problems. Each notebook walks through preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization—ideal for learning or referencing ensemble tree methods in machine learning.

## Notebooks Included
1. **Random Forest Classification.ipynb**  
   Implement and evaluate a Random Forest classifier (e.g., with a dataset like Iris or Titanic), complete with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

2. **Random Forest Regression.ipynb**  
   Demonstrate how to use a Random Forest regressor to predict continuous outcomes—showcasing metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and visual assessment of performance.

## Installation & Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/Random-Forest-Models.git
   cd Random-Forest-Models
2. Install dependencies:

```bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
```
(If a requirements.txt file is added in the future, update the instructions accordingly.)

Launch Jupyter:

```bash

jupyter notebook
```
Open either Random Forest Classification.ipynb or Random Forest Regression.ipynb to follow along with the demos.

## Notebook Highlights
- Notebook	Key Concepts Covered
- Random Forest Classification	Training, prediction, OOB score, confusion matrix, feature importance
- Random Forest Regression	Predicting continuous values, error metrics (MAE/MSE/RMSE), feature analysis

Feel free to customize datasets, hyperparameters, or add visualizations for deeper exploration.

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! Here are some ideas:

- Add a requirements.txt or environment file for dependencies.

- Introduce notebook for Hyperparameter Tuning (e.g., using Grid Search or Random Search).

- Provide comparisons with other ensemble methods (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).

- Add real-world datasets or extended analysis, visualizations, or explanations.

- Just fork the repo, add your features, and submit a pull request.
